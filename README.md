Project Description:
    As the name suggests, this project is going to model space invaders. I am going to create the ship, and I also want to implement a system where either your ship changes and gets cooler looking after every level you pass, or you can choose your ship at the beginning. The game will have a bunch of levels, and they will get harder and harder as you progress, which means more aliens and stronger aliens. Also, the game will have the blockades that the original game has, and as you progress they will be destroyed and you will have the chance to get more. Also, the game will have powerups, like double cannons, more blockades, and bombs. You will get these when you kill a certain amounts of monsters or you defeat a boss. The ship will also get more powerful as you pass levels. 

Development Log:
5/23: I basically started the basics of the project. I created all of the classes, and wrote the most basic form of all of the constructors, just making sure that everything ran smoothly.
5/24: I created the more complex constructors for all of the classes that take in colors, position, and speed. I also wrote the display methods and created the initial form of the ship and the aliens, along with move methods and a bugged draw method.
